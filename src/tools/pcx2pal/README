Thanks to Antti Tapaninen for Linux makefile and binaries.

NO TECH SUPPORT PROVIDED

Includes:
- Pcx2wal texture converter
- Tools for using custom palettes
- Source code for all of the above

Platforms:
DOS
Win32  (pcx2wal.exe only - DOS versions for others work fine)
Linux

Supports all features of .wal files, including default flags, contents and
values for QE4. The source code is included and is trivial to compile. It
compiles with DOS GCC (DJGPP) as is, and in LCCwin32, VC5 and Linux GCC with
slight changes.

Instructions:

The programs for different platforms are placed in subdirectories
dos, win32 and linux. Dos/win source code is in source directory, and
the linux sources are in the linux directory with binaries.

You need to copy the colormap.pcx, palette.pal and 16to8.dat to your
work directory in order to use pcx2wal from there. It's recommended
to have the suitable pcx2wal executable in your path. For example, copy
win32/pcx2wal.exe to where you keep utils like pkunzip.

What's new:
- Added texture path parameter
- Added automatic animation

Usage:
PCX2WAL <texture.pcx> [texture2.pcx] [texture3.pcx] ... [options]

(Mass-op example: pcx2wal *.pcx -p -d -a)

Options:
-o <output.wal>  : Set the output file. By default, it's made from the
                   source file name, e.g. foo.pcx -> foo.wal
-t <texture path>: Set the texture directory name, e.g. e1u1/
-n <animation>   : Set next animation frame... like anim0, anim1, anim2..
-f <flags>       : Set default surface flags for texture (see below)
-c <contents>    : Default content flags
-v <value>       : Default value (for lights .. flags&1 is light)
-a               : Makes animated textures automatically
-p               : Ignores palette, use if your .pcx has Q2 palette already.
                   This makes it run 3 times faster.
-d               : Uses 16to8.dat file to find colors for rgb value. Makes
                   per-pixel operations approx. 200 times faster.                

Surface flags (add together to combine effects... 8+16 for water etc):
  1: Light   - this makes the texture emit light.
  2: Slick   - sets the surface slippery.
  4: Sky     - show sky instead of a texture here
  8: Warp    - for liquids
 16: Trans33 - transparent surface
 32: Trans66 - transparent surface (less transparent than trans33)
 64: flow    - moving texture?
128: nodraw  - makes the engine not draw the polygon. (use for skies with 4?)

Content flags:
  1: solid
  2: window
  4: aux (unused)
  8: lava
 16: slime
 32: water
 64: mist

Auto animation:
For -a option, you need .pcx files with names starting with _ and a number
0-9. For example, _0tex.pcx, _1tex.pcx, _2tex.pcx ... The first must be 0.
I used _ instead of + to make some operating systems recognize the
filenames :)

Required files:
PCX2WAL requires a file "palette.pal" to run. It's a 768-byte piece that can
be extracted from a 256c PCX file (e.g. colormap.pcx) with the included
PCX2PAL.EXE. File named "16to8.dat" (extracted from Quake2 pak0.pak) is
needed for -d option. It's basically 16bit to q2 palette conversion table.

Place the resulting .wal files in quake2/baseq2/textures/mytex/ or something
similar, and use option -t mytex/ in pcx2wal. Of course, use a UNIQUE dir
name instead of "mytex" if you are going to distribute the textures, to
avoid texture name collisions.

If you're using a custom palette for a Quake2 conversion, make a pcx picture 
with that palette, and run pcx2pal.exe, colormap.exe, and 16to8.exe to 
create all the files you need to run pcx2wal and Quake2 with your custom
palette.

You may use this program and source code for anything you want, if you give
me the credit for doing it first. If you're a coder and doing another texture
utility based on this, I might answer code-related questions if I find time.
